<body>
	<p>My reflection on Phase 0 to this point is a mixed bag, as I am developing and trying to harness my skill set to best help me accelerate my learning I feel inhibited by having to write reflections on how I feel and other abstract notions. I do feel that I do need to continue on the process and allocate equal amounts of time in learning and reflecting.  I think as a developing programmer the end product is never really in site and things are always changing.  I need to figure out a way to change my perspective.  I am in a <b>fixed mindset</b>  I believe that things are the way they are and can't be changed.  I need to change into a <b>Growth Mindset</b> where I can learn from failures and have my brain phyically change into a more happy productive human being. </p>
