#### "Git 'er Done With Version Control'
#### 9/18/14

+ Version control is one of those things that anybody creating any project from a manuscript, to a computer programer.  Version control has many benifits:
1. You made a mistake and want to rewind back to
2. You lost code and need to revert back to it
3. You have to have multiple versions of code
4. You need to see the 'git diff' in your code
5. You want to track the history of your code
6. want to know who you need to blame

+ Version Control helps us keep track of our development.  It also allows us to revert back to certain dates. It also allows us to have multiple versions of our code

+  it keeps track of the changes we have made and stores it into a repository.  We can keep track of these changes on multiple verions or branches.  If you hate the changes you made or someone else made you can just delete the branch or version of the code.  It's a great way to organize and try to protect yourself from completlty screwing up a project

+ "But version control systems such as Git keep track of the changes you make as you go along and store all of the changes in a repository.  In Git, your repository has a master branch and this is where the latest, properly working version of your code resides. When you want to make a change or add features, Git enables you to copy the code from the master branch and place it on a "new branch."  You then can work on and make changes to this “copy” of the code.  If you screw up or dislike what you have changed or added, you can always throw out this branch and revert back to the previous copy that is still held on the master branch.  But if you do like what you have done and these changes work properly, you can merge this new code back into the master branch.  By "committing" this new version of the master branch, you are saving a new "official" version of your code and updating the master branch. ""

+ This version control and tracking of changes is extremely important when you have more than one person working on the same file/project.  Instead of overwriting one another's changes or having to manually compare and merge changes from one person with those of another, Git takes care of all of this for you.  By creating branches for each person to work on, multiple people can work on the same file/project at the same time and this increases the efficiency and effectiveness of the project team.  Each team member's changes are later merged into a single version and the system highlights conflicts or problems for you and the rest of the team.   

+ But Git is software that lives locally on a single person's computer and those files/versions are not accessible by others.  In order for the collaboration described above to work, the repository and each team member's files need to somehow be made remote by uploading them to and storing them in the cloud.  This is where Github comes in.  Github lives remotely, on the Internet, and stores the team's versions in the cloud so they are accessible by each other.  Now the entire team can collectively take advantage of the benefits of version control.
