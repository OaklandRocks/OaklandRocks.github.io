<!-- This template is in markdown, not html, so
  it will not render beautifully when you copy and
  paste it into your github.io site, but it will at
  least be published. Next week you'll be creating a
  blog template using HTML and CSS and you'll be able
  to copy and paste the blog posts from week 1 in there
  to make them pretty next week.

  For now, please replace the title, subtitle (if desired),
  and date with the text you would like. Markdown is pretty
  simple, so you can just feel free to type. =) -->

#### What mindset
#### 9-22-2014

* My expectations coming into this was that I was going to code, learn technical aspects of becoming a back end engineer.  I was not expecting transoformational education.

* After watching the DBC video I didn't realize that Shareef was such a pitch man.  I didn't expect him to be so charismatic and poetic with the perfect buzz words.  He also has a sweet beard.

* He is a good at putting himself into the mindset of a student with his two fears.

* and yes this makes me nervous
