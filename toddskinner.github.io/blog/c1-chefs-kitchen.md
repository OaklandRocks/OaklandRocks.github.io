#### Chefs in the Kitchen
#### 9/19/14

After watching Shereef's Fireside Chat video I have to say that I really like the Kitchen vs. Restaurant analogy for how to approach education.  I've never thought about it like that before and to frame it that way adds a great deal of clarity to the issue.  I definitely agree that it is the students’ responsibility to take a "Chefs" approach and be fully accountable for how much one gets out of the program (of course, this assumes that the program adminstrators/instructors have stocked the "kitchen" with the proper tools, equipment, and ingredients to create an environment conducive to students' success).  Without a doubt I was guilty of taking a more "Restaurant" or "consumer" approach to education, especially during my undergraduate years.  Chalk that up to inexperience or under appreciation of the opportunity and resources I had at my disposal at that time. Whatever the reason, if I could go back in time, I would have done things differently and taken more control and had more of a sense of ownership over my education.  I also would have approached it with a greater sense of humility and more of a willingness to ask “stupid” questions.  Given this new perspective, I intend to approach my education via DBC differently.  

Based on the video, my impression of DBC has stayed constant.  I was aware of DBC's reputation for focusing on the soft skills on top of the actual technical skills, and the video merely served to reinforce that impression.  I believe that I've always been someone who has thrived and felt most comfortable in cooperative, team-based environments and by stressing this, DBC is only preaching to the choir.  For the past few months I have been trying to teach myself how to code on my own and I became frustrated with the fact that I didn't have anyone else to bounce ideas off of or work through a problem together.  It was that desire for a more collaborative environment that was one of my primary motivations for seeking out a program like DBC. So my expectations and level of anticipation for the program have not changed.
