	<h5>Classes</h5>
	<p>Classes are a great way to keep objects seperated and to keep code maintainable.  Each class has a set of instructions to let it interact with other objects.  Some of these objects are wrapped up inside the class itself.  It is a good idea to keep your methods within these classes to keep objects functionality seperated and ordered.</p><br>

	<p>We will want to build a class that has two arguments sleep and drinks.  In the arguements we set default values so that when creating a new instance of the class we do not have to put in the arguments they will be set for us.</p>
